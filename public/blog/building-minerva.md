# Building Minerva: A GPT-Powered Learning Companion

When we started thinking about how to help students learn software development more effectively, we realized that traditional resources often fall short. Students need interactive, personalized guidance that meets them where they are.

## The Challenge

Learning to code can be overwhelming. Students face:
- Information overload from too many resources
- Difficulty getting timely help when stuck
- Lack of personalized feedback on their code
- Isolation when learning independently

## Enter Minerva

Minerva is a Discord bot powered by GPT that acts as a personal tutor for software development students. The bot can:

- Answer programming questions in natural language
- Provide code examples and explanations
- Debug issues by analyzing code snippets
- Suggest learning paths based on student goals
- Encourage best practices and clean code

## Technical Implementation

We built Minerva using:
- **Discord.js** for bot framework
- **OpenAI GPT API** for natural language processing
- **Node.js** for backend logic
- **PostgreSQL** for conversation history

The key was finding the right balance between being helpful and encouraging independent learning. Minerva doesn't just give answers - it guides students toward solutions.

## Results

Since launching Minerva in our Discord server:
- Students report faster problem-solving
- Code quality has improved
- Community engagement has increased
- Learning feels more collaborative

## What's Next

We're working on adding:
- Multi-language support
- Code execution sandbox for safe testing
- Integration with GitHub for code reviews
- Personalized learning progress tracking

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/move-fast-and-break-things/minerva). We'd love your contributions!

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start simple** - MVP first, features later
2. **Listen to users** - Student feedback shaped everything
3. **Iterate quickly** - We deployed updates almost daily
4. **Community matters** - The bot is only as good as the community using it

Building Minerva taught us that the best learning happens through conversation and experimentation. We moved fast, broke things (a lot!), and learned from every mistake.
